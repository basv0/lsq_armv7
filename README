Functions for least square parametrical identification.

mnk_optim is based upon direc matrix operation for lsq 
and is optimized for speed

mnk_neonh is the same function as above but uses intrinsics
for Armv7 NEON and so called horizontal vectorization

mnk_neonv also uses intrinsics for Armv7 NEON and but instead
of horizontal implements verticacal vectorization

ident3.dat sample file with the experimental data that
are used for parametrical identification of the object
of control. The order of object is equal to 3.
